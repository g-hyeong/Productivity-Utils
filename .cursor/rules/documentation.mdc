# Documentation Standards for Utils Project

This project follows specific documentation standards to maintain consistency and clarity across all modules.

## General Documentation Rules

### Language Requirements
- All documentation must be bilingual: Korean and English
- Use the format: `[한국어](mdc:#한국어) | [English](mdc:#english)` at the top
- Separate sections with `---`
- Korean section comes first, followed by English section

### Structure Requirements
- Keep main [README.md](mdc:README.md) concise and focused on overview
- Each module must have its own detailed README in its directory
- Main README should only contain:
  - Project overview and purpose
  - Module introductions with links to detailed READMEs
  - Quick start guide with essential commands only

### Content Guidelines
- Main README should be module-agnostic and scalable
- Detailed installation, configuration, and usage instructions belong in module-specific READMEs
- Remove project structure sections from main README to keep it brief
- Focus on essential information and direct users to appropriate module documentation

### Code and Comments
- All code comments must be in Korean (concise)
- All logging messages must be in English
- Code blocks in documentation should have English comments

### Header Requirements
All documentation files must include this header at the very top in both languages:

```
*이 문서는 Cursor에 의해 생성되었습니다. 오류가 있으면 제보해주세요.*  
*This document was generated by Cursor. Please report any errors.*

```

Each module should follow this structure:
- Bilingual title and navigation
- Overview/purpose section
- Key features list
- Installation & configuration (detailed)
- Usage examples with code blocks
